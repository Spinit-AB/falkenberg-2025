# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is a .NET Aspire application composed of multiple services:
- **AspireApp.ApiService**: Backend API service
- **AspireApp.Web**: Blazor Web frontend
- **AspireApp.AppHost**: Orchestrates service startup and configuration
- **AspireApp.ServiceDefaults**: Shared service configuration and extensions

### Architecture & Data Flow
- The AppHost coordinates startup for both the API and Web services.
- The Web frontend communicates with the API via HTTP (see `WeatherApiClient.cs` for example usage).
- Shared configuration and service defaults are centralized in `AspireApp.ServiceDefaults`.
- Each service has its own `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json` for environment-specific configuration.

## Developer Workflows
- **Build Solution**: Use `dotnet build AspireApp.sln` from the repo root.
- **Run Locally**: Launch via AppHost (`dotnet run --project AspireApp.AppHost/AspireApp.AppHost.csproj`). This starts all services for local development.
- **Debugging**: Use launch profiles in `Properties/launchSettings.json` for each service. AppHost is the entry point for multi-service debugging.
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and settings are managed per service. Update `appsettings.*.json` as needed.

## Patterns & Conventions
- **Service Boundaries**: Each service is isolated in its own directory and project file.
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and clients are registered via DI in `Program.cs` of each service.
- **HTTP Communication**: The Web frontend uses typed HTTP clients (see `WeatherApiClient.cs`) to call the API.
- **Shared Extensions**: Common service configuration is factored into `AspireApp.ServiceDefaults/Extensions.cs`.
- **Environment-Specific Settings**: Use the appropriate `appsettings.Development.json` for local overrides.

## Integration Points
- **External Dependencies**: NuGet packages are managed per project via `.csproj` files.
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Web â†’ API via HTTP; no direct references between service projects except through AppHost orchestration.

## Key Files & Directories
- `AspireApp.sln`: Solution file for building all projects
- `AspireApp.AppHost/`: Orchestration and startup logic
- `AspireApp.ApiService/`: Backend API logic
- `AspireApp.Web/`: Blazor Web frontend and components
- `AspireApp.ServiceDefaults/`: Shared configuration and extensions
- `WeatherApiClient.cs`: Example of HTTP client usage in frontend
- `Extensions.cs`: Shared service configuration patterns

## Example: Adding a New Service
1. Create a new project in its own directory.
2. Register the service in AppHost for orchestration.
3. Use DI and configuration patterns as in existing services.

For questions or unclear conventions, ask for clarification or review the structure of existing services for guidance.
